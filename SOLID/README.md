## Preview <a name="Preview"></a>

In 2002 Robert Martin published his book, Agile Software Development, Principles, Patterns, and Practices. In it he
describes five principles of reusable software design, which he called the SOLID principles, after the first letters in
their names. </br>

Single Responsibility Principle </br>
Open/Closed Principle </br>
Liskov Substitution Principle </br>
Interface Segregation Principle </br>
Dependency Inversion Principle </br>

These principles quickly became well known and popular in the software industry. These rules are language independent,
they are the most general principles of code layout. In this document, I dissect and learn how to use it in go to write
good code. </br>
