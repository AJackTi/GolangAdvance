When naming packages, choose a name that is:

All lower-case. No capitals or underscores.
Does not need to be renamed using named imports at most call sites.
Short and succinct. Remember that the name is identified in full at every call site.
Not plural. For example, net/url, not net/urls.
Not "common", "util", "shared", or "lib". These are bad, uninformative names.
