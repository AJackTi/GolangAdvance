A popular series in the golang community is 100 Go Mistakes, the author covers a wide range of issues in golang, both
theory and practice during code development. However, maybe due to the resouce, the code of the book is sometimes not
really clear and detailed examples, as well as some views that have not been deepened. I will develop more code for the
example section and add my views and best practices. Hope it is useful to everyone. Enjoy, relax and be happy with it. </br>
