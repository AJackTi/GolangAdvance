/*
 Concurrency pattern in golang from golang development team, other resource, other frame... and my experience
 Concurrency is simple run and not simple stop. It has many problem with code concurrency.
 It's not dependence anything frame or packet.
 It is maybe use in everything in golang code.
 It's use for me as an as doc research and search.
 I didn't create it, it's not clear who first created it, but I synthesized it and deepened it for my work.
 I will it's hope help someone up to up golang skills, i'm very happy if it happened.
 Enjoy and relax it.
