A famous quote in the programming world: "Don't just check errors, handle them gracefully". I have a description of it
in the
link: https://github.com/Nghiait123456/GolangAdvance/tree/master/Proverbs#DontJustCheckErrorsHandleThemGracefully.
Effective error handling is an extremely important part that directly affects the quality of the project. </br>

In golang, error is treated as a variable and is treated as a variable. It is very difficult to find a consistent rule
for error handling for most cases in go, which is nearly impossible. In this document, I present techniques for graceful
and efficient error handling and best practices from my experience. </br>
